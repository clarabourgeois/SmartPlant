# SmartPlant App : Keep in touch with your beloved plants wherever you are !

## This is the non functionnal version of the App with our best tries to implement the backend API. This is there to show you our efforts in trying to implement a failing backend
## we did not manage to handle the null values for the current_temperature due to the structure of the Backend and had too little time to correct it to a sufficient extent.

Here is the link to the GitHub repository to the functionnal version without the API's implementation :

https://github.com/Clairevanr/SmartPlant_app_beforeAPI/tree/main

## The App's features :

### Homepage

A page to greet the user before he clicks on a button to access the list of his plants.

### List of plants 

The user can then scroll through his plants and click on the one he wants to get details from.

### Details on plants

The current temperature and humidity surrounding the plant are displayed there. The user can also find 
indications on what he has to do to take care of them.

### Menu

The menu is a top bar allowing the user to navigate through the app.

The ideal was to be able to create a plant. Our efforts to implement the API lead to failure.
For this reason, there is the version with the API while the version that is working (without it, which 
will still give you an idea of what I had in mind) is in another GitHub repository that is at your
disposal.
